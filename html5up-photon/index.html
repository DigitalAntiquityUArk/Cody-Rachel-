							<b>Infant burial—children under the age of 1.</b> 
							According to the roman written sources, written largely by the male elite in Rome, the formal mourning of children who died before the age of three was forbidden.  In reality epitaphs reveal that very young children were indeed mourned and commemorated by their parents—accounting for 1.3% of funerary inscriptions.  The physical and archeological remains of infant burials are of vital importance in recognizing less visible attitudes toward infancy and the status of the youngest children in Roman society and the family.  The remains allow us to study and recognize the discrepancies between public displays of mourning and private expressions of grief and loss, as recognizable in the burial assemblages of the most vulnerable individuals.
							Late Roman Infant Cemetery inside Villa. 
							Many infants buried in amphoras, with the head pointing toward the mouth and the rest of the body pointing toward the bottom.  Many times the amphoras had to be broken in order the fit the fetus inside.  Overlapping cover tiles, travertine stone, mortar, and pan tile fragments were used to decorate and seal the vessel.  Sometimes copper alloy vessels or rings (or other objects of worth) were buried on top of the amphora as funerary offerings.  Sometimes fetal remains were laid on a bed of small mound of sherds, rubble stones, pan tile fragments, and cubilia (hypothesized to be highly uncelebrated burial of someone who was very poor or homeless).  Sometimes inhumations were surrounded by a ring of stones or pebbles as part of a burial preparation or funerary ritual.  Legs (or trunk) always point south while head always points north.  Sometimes infants or fetuses buried in groups.  </div>
