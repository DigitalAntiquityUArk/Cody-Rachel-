At Gabii, private houses constructed in a manner that suggests development towards the canonical atrium-style residence are being excavated. These reveal a number of architectural solutions that throw light on the origins of some later Roman standbys, like the decorated opus signinum or “cocciopesto” floor (Gallone and Mogetta 2011) or the open-floor axial tablinum. Most of the architecture identified within Areas A and B can be dated to 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, on the basis of the materials recovered in construction fills and in the road layers associated with this occupation. In their earliest phases, these buildings feature an elongated rectangular wing of rooms opening onto a courtyard to the west. In the case of the Area B house, an impluvium was later incorporated in the courtyard. 
In Area C, the templated design of the canonical atrium house was inserted into a quite sizable (at least 660 sq. m) pre-existing structure, a fact that explains why the access was not on axis with the tablinum but from one side, thus creating asymmetrical alae.  In Area F, a public complex laid out on three terraces has been uncovered (Gallone, Mogetta and Johnston 2016). This represents the largest and the best-preserved civic space in central Italy for its period to date. The complex, provided with double-atria on the middle terrace and featuring a large open space in the top terrace, does not conform to any know Late Republican building type. Indeed, it seems to combine apparent residential elements with hallmark signs of public construction, such as a massive pillared facade on the road. Two fragments of early public inscriptions from the same area confirm the high level of urban activity in this phase (Fortson and Potter 2011; Johnston 2015).

The excavation is producing tantalizing evidence on the re-adaptation of the town after its significant contraction during the Late Republican period. Signs of profound changes in the organization of the settlement have been identified in Areas A, B and C, where domestic features were replaced by industrial installations. The elite house of Area C was repurposed into a laundry or tannery, whose new floor preparation shows the imprint of circular features (perhaps for dolia or vats, which were clearly robbed at a later stage). The new complex features a pavement built with reworked basalt slabs, which incorporates a complex system of drainages connected to a well suggesting that activities requiring substantial amounts of water were conducted there. The most dramatic transformation occurred in Areas A and B in the Imperial period, which is characterized by the rapid expansion of the quarry works exploiting the local tuff, a type of peperino that the ancients called Lapis Gabinus (Farr 2014; Farr, Marra and Terrenato 2015). The houses became untenable as the quarry works moved from the edge of the crater downslope. The structures were abandoned and razed to the ground to make room for the quarry infrastructure. The side street traversing this part of the city, however, remained in use, presumably to facilitate the removal of the quarried stone. Several quarry cuts deliberately avoid truncating the road itself, allowing a reasonably secure sense of the continuity of Gabii’s road network. Perhaps signaling the transformation of this zone (and of the city itself), a small necropolis began to grow in the area of the former structure in Area B by the mid- or late 1st century CE at the latest. The cemetery is mostly comprised of “a cappucina” tombs (mostly dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries CE) and of simple “a fossa” tombs (some of which belong to a later phase between the 3rd and 5th centuries BCE), of both male and female adult individuals (though child burials are also attested). These were generally interred without grave goods. The preliminary skeletal pathology shows evidence for physical stresses and injuries that come from repetitive motion, as well as many healed, traumatic wounds, making it likely that most of the deceased in this necropolis worked as manual laborers either in an agricultural setting or in the adjacent tuff quarries. A notable exception is represented by three wealthy burials using lead sheeting. Overall, the necropolis is a clear indication of the decaying of the urban center and the abandonment, by stages, of portions of the city. The phenomenon, however, should be read in parallel with the retasking of formerly inhabited space, which was taken over for activities previously relegated at the outskirts of town, adding an interesting facet to the realities of contracting cities in imperial Latium (Patterson 2006).
