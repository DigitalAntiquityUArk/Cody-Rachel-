							<p><b>Project Hypothesis</b></p>
							<p>Our study focuses on the burial practices of the Gabii people circa 800-400 B.C.E.  We have examined the area using the Ark data.  We also analyzed most of the 3D models from the area, including infant and adult burials, skeletons, and ceremonial burial fragments.  We sought to better understand the burial practices of the Gabii people during this time and have made certain steps to do so.  We mainly referenced literature from The British School at Rome.  We also referenced papers from other sources in order to get a more globalized view of burial practices during this time period.  Understanding how a group treats their dead is fundamental in understanding that civilization as a whole.  Our research findings will be discussed in detail throughout the website and final comments can be found in the conclusion.     </p>
							<p><b>Infant burial--children under the age of 1.</b></p> 
							<p>According to the roman written sources, written largely by the male elite in Rome, the formal mourning of children who died before the age of three was forbidden.  In reality epitaphs reveal that very young children were indeed mourned and commemorated by their parents—accounting for 1.3% of funerary inscriptions.  The physical and archeological remains of infant burials are of vital importance in recognizing less visible attitudes toward infancy and the status of the youngest children in Roman society and the family.  The remains allow us to study and recognize the discrepancies between public displays of mourning and private expressions of grief and loss, as recognizable in the burial assemblages of the most vulnerable individuals.</p>
							<p><b>Late Roman Infant Cemetery inside Italian Villa.</b></p> 
							<p>A comparative study was conducted on a late Roman infant cemetary inside a villa near Lugnano-In-Teverina, Italy.  The report on the excavations provided informative descriptions on forty seven burials as well as detailed analysis of each.  It's infant cemetary provides this study with an example of late roman burial rite, or lack thereof, and a basis for comparison with the infant burials of Area D of the Gabii project.  The site was constructed in the second half of the first century B.C.E. but the life of the villa continued through a number of phases until the late fifth to early sixth century A.D.  Many infants were buried in amphoras, with the head pointing toward the mouth and the rest of the body pointing toward the bottom.  Many times the amphoras had to be broken in order the fit the fetus inside.  Overlapping cover tiles, travertine stone, mortar, and pan tile fragments were used to decorate and seal the vessel.  Sometimes copper alloy vessels or rings (or other objects of worth) were buried on top of the amphora as funerary offerings.  Sometimes fetal remains were laid on a bed of small mound of sherds, rubble stones, pan tile fragments, and cubilia (hypothesized to be highly uncelebrated burial of someone who was very poor or homeless).  Sometimes inhumations were surrounded by a ring of stones or pebbles as part of a burial preparation or funerary ritual.  Legs (or trunk) often times point south while the head points north.  Sometimes infants or fetuses buried in groups.  Some of the infants buried within this site showed signs of a condition called Cribia Orbitalia.  Cribia Orbitalia is a condition characterized by expanded spongy tissue in the frontal bone, cranial base and marrow cavity of the long bones.   </p>  
							<p><b>Infant burials in Area D</b></p>
							<p>In exploring area D, one will find seven neonate/infant burials throughout.  You will even find one turtle burial, which may speak to the status of the people buried in this area.  We chose two distinctly different burials for research purposes.  Most findings at area D coincide with literature sources of similar cities in Italy.  One difference noticed was the use of a dolium instead of an amphorae.  The use of certain types of roman containers most likely stemmed from availability.  Infant burials were generally plain with limited adornments.  If adornments did exist, they were buried with the infant out of plain sight of the public, as mourning infant death was not a common practice in this area at this time.  SU-3624: Newborn, possibly stillborn buried in supine position.  Cut not well done, mabye burial of a poorer family.  Burial packed with stone.  Body was adorned with a small cup and a bronze object.  SU 3008: Archaeic infant burial in doluium (a type of container similar to amphorae).  Date of burial ambiguous due to lack of adornments.   </p>
							<p><b>Adult Burials in 7-6c BCE Italy</b></p>
							<p>Mortuary variability has long been used to try and determine the status of the buried individual. This has been contested in recent decades, but it is reasonable to assume that most elements of a burial are made by conscious decision and that there were so factors motivating these decisions. In adults, mortuary variability can occur in any burial features, including: depth of grave, tomb/ burial type (i.e. locolus, chamber, etc.), grave position, body position, burial overlap with other graves, the presence and composition of grave goods, and the presence and composition of banqueting sets. Differences in grave constructions can reflect differences in the amount of effort required for that burial. Some scholars would argue that an individual buried in an elaborate, deeply cut tomb was probably someone more respected or of higher status than an individual in a shallow, simple grave because less time and effort would have to been required to execute the latter. Burial location relative to other burials can be indicative of some higher social structure as well. For instance, if graves are radially distributed around a central burial, it is clear that the individual of this central grave bore significant importance. Grave overlapping can be the result of the emergence of a tradition to bury related individuals near one another, or simply the result of limited grave space. Grave goods are typically buried with a person as indications of who they were during their lives (especially personal items). Also, it was traditional practice to hold a funeral banquet for a deceased individual as a part of the ceremony to honor their life. Commonly, the dishes used during the banquet were left in the tomb of the individual as a gift for them in the afterlife. Grave goods and banqueting were buried with individuals with varying frequency throughout the 7-5c BCE, with later periods reflecting diminished use of gave goods and banqueting sets. </p>
							<p><b>Adult burials in Area D</b></p>
							<p>The adult burials we have included here are two adult skeletons from two different multiple-niche chamber tombs. Skeleton #39 is from a chamber tomb with 3 different loculi, with one deposition per locolus. This burial is fairly bare, containing only the skeleton with no grave goods or banqueting set items. This is combination with the rise in popularity of chamber tombs in later centuries, leads us to believe this individual was from the Archaic period. The skeleton’s relationship to the other two skeletons within the same tomb is not obvious.  In the 3-loculus chamber tombs found in Crustumerium typically contained 2 adults and one child, possibly suggesting familial relationships. Very few contained all adults, and sexes varied greatly. This tomb contained all adults, which provides an interesting contrast to the Crustumerium graves. Skeleton #41 is from a chamber tomb containing two loculi, which are positioned laterally to the tomb practice (as one common practice for this specific burial type). No banquet sets or grave goods were found as part of the burial. It is likely this grave too is from the Archaic period, for the same reasons mentioned above. It is interesting to note that this chamber tomb contained one male (skeleton #41) and one female skeleton, both of which had 3 molars suggesting a possible genetic relationship between the two. Chamber tombs containing two loculi found at the Crustumerium contained either one male and one female or two males, so this tomb does align with that convention established there. </p>
							<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
							<p>Our working hypothesis, site examination, and in depth literature research has lead us to certain conclusions. As for the adult skeletons 39 and 41, they can probably be dated to the Archaic period based on the their deposition within a multiple-locoli chamber tomb and the absence of grave ornamentations like grave goods and banquet sets (as all of these burial features came into greater use during this period). Burial features for these can be attributed to changes in burial trends and common practice, and less likely to indicate low status or respect by remaining community and family members. </p></div>

								<h2>The Archeological Process</h2>
							</header>
							<p><b>What is archeology? </b></p>
							<p>Archeology is the study of the human past through material remains.  In particular, archeologists are interested in human behavior, human ecodynamics, and human-thing entanglement.  Cultural heritage is an expression of the ways of living developed by a community and passed on from generation to generation, including customs, practices, places, objects, artistic expressions, and values.  Archeologists try and understand the specific cultural heritage of a specific group of people or of a certain area.    </p>
							<p><b>What is digital archeology?</b></p>
							<p>It is somewhat of a hybrid discipline combining the sciences and humanities.  Digital science componenets include geophysical survey, geochemical analysis, topographic survey, airborne remote sensing, enviornmental systems modeling, agent based modeling, and open data.  Digital humanities include game-based modeling, interactive media, data visualizaiton, text mining, communication, social impact of technology, and public heratige engagement.  </p>

							<h3>Map of Gabii Project</h3>
							<p>Area D is one of four archaeological sites that make up the Gabii, Italy project. For this project we were interested in examining differences in burial trends across the Gabii site. We chose to focus on Area D because of the presence of multiple adult and infant burials. Within each subset there was a substantial amount of mortuary variability between different burials.   </p>

							<h3>Amphora</h3>
							<p>During the 8th, 7th, 6th, and early 5th century BCE, poorer families generally buried deceased infants in terracotta containers of characteristic shape and size.  The infants were placed in the wine jugs (amphorae) or earthware vase (dolium), with the head facing the mouth and the body or trunk pointed towards the bottom of the vessel.  The amphorae, like the one pictured above, were many times broken in half to accomodate an infant or neonate that was too large.  These containers have also been known to serve as grave markers or simple decorative adornments for the dead.  </p>

							<h3>Burial</h3>
							<p>Most adult and infant burials were carried out in graves.  Pictured above is an infant grave.  The main difference between infant and adult burials were the depth and overall size of the grave.  Burying infants under the age of one was not a respected practice in Italy during this time.  For this reason, many infant burials are less adorned or ceremonialized than that of adults.  </p>
